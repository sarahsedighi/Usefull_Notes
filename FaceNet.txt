1- Installing:
pip install keras-facenet

2- Usage:
from keras_facenet import FaceNet
embedder = FaceNet()

# Gets a detection dict for each face
# in an image. Each one has the bounding box and
# face landmarks (from mtcnn.MTCNN) along with
# the embedding from FaceNet.
detections = embedder.extract(image, threshold=0.95)

# If you have pre-cropped images, you can skip the
# detection step.
embeddings = embedder.embeddings(images)
